What is Redux

redux is a container where you can store your whole application data
(not database)
that is why we call it a state management

it does not belong to the componenet state

frontend ke andr lgta hai like:-userdata,dynamic datas ,..etc

Why needed?

kyuki recat ke andr hm alg alg component bnate hai aur do component k bich me 
contact kranan bhut muskil hota hai (nested props)(prop drilling)

(Context Api bhi use krte hai iskeliye )



Redux toolkit is preffered



Redux Architecture:-

Action:-collect data from component or Api
Reducer:-Get data from action and send to store
Store:-Satate of complete application
View:-React component


# Ek application ke andar ek hi store hoga 



npm i redux ,
npm i react-redux
